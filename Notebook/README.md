# Notes for machine learning
This notebook is inspired by the git project [100-Days-Of-ML](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code). After reading some codes 
from the project, I realized that it would be a good  way to write down learning stuffs here in case that you will need 
it in the future. So the context is drastically extended to anything realte to ML and orgnised in a very flexible way.
